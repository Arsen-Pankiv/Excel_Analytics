Slicers empower users to interactively refine the displayed salary data, making the dashboard highly customizable and relevant to specific job search, hiring, or market research needs.


**Job title:** This slicer allows users to select and filter salary data by specific roles within data science, such as "Senior Data Engineer," "Data Scientist," "Data Analyst," and "Machine Learning Engineer." This helps users focus on the roles most relevant to their inquiry.

**Country:** This slicer enables users to narrow down the salary information by geographical location.

**Job type:** This slicer provides the ability to filter by employment type, with "Full-time" currently selected. Other options like "Part-time," "Temp work," and "Contractor" are likely available. This allows users to compare salaries based on different employment arrangements.

**In addition to the slicers, the dashboard also features a histogram titled "How much do Data Science jobs make?". This visualization displays the distribution of salaries, showing the frequency  within different salary ranges. It helps users understand where most salaries fall and identify common salary brackets.**
